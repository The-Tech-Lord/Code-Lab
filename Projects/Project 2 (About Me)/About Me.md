# About Me

**Name**: MD Raiyan Hossain
**Grade**: 10

## Summary

I like Programming, Electronics, IT, and all that techy stuff. I'm not too social, at this time, I'm right now learning to program in C and have made a couple simple programs in it (Pointers took me a while to learn). I know some HTML but not alot. I got into programming in 8th grade. I'm mostly on a computer most the day, which will come in handy since I want to be a Software Developer, or work in Robotics, and I'd already be used to being in front of a computer all day. Right now I'm learning how to program in C and have learned quite a lot in just 2 weeks, and plan on learning Java after and some other older languages like Perl, Lua, and Lisp, its something about the syntax that catches my eye. I'm sort-of an introvert and not too social around people, but I am social around my friends.
